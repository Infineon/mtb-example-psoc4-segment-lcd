The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-psoc4-segment-lcd](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-segment-lcd)" application with the desired name "SegmentLCD" configured for the *CY8CKIT-149* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-041S-MAX --app-id mtb-example-psoc4-segment-lcd --user-app-name SegmentLCD --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```


The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-041S-MAX TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

3. Press user switch (WAKEUP_PIN) either to enter low-power mode or active mode. The LED connected to LP_OUT_PIN is switched ON when the device is in active power mode. This goes OFF if the device enters low-power mode.

4. When in active power mode, the counter value is incremented and displayed on the LCD every second.

5. When the device is in low-power mode, the LCD will turn OFF. After wakeup, the counter value is incremented from the last counter value before deep sleep and is displayed on the LCD with one second interval.

**Note:**
   The following table shows the LED and switch configurations for the supported PSoC&trade; 4 kits:

BSP  |  LED     |   Switch    |
 :------- | :------------    | :------------ |
[CY8CKIT-149](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-149) | P2[0] | P3[7]
[CY8CKIT-145-40XX](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-145-40XX) | P2[0] | P0[7]
[CY8CKIT-041S-MAX](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-041S-MAX) | P7[3] | P11[5]
[CY8CKIT-045S](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CKIT-045S) | P1[6] | P1[2]

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

This design consists of the Segment LCD, TCPWM, Interrupt, Clock, and Pins peripherals. The Segment LCD is configured for the particular 4-digit, 7-segment LCD with 4 common and 8 segment lines. The TCPWM is configured in the Timer/Counter mode to generate an interrupt every one second. The ISR code increments a counter variable and prints its value on the LCD. A dedicated pin (WAKEUP_PIN) is used to enter deep sleep from active mode and is used as a wakeup source to bring back the device from deep sleep mode. Mode transition is indicated by the LP_OUT_PIN (LED), which is cleared in deep sleep mode and set to HIGH in active mode.

### Resources and settings

Do the following to set up the peripheral parameters in Device Configurator:

1. Open Device Configurator from the **Quick Panel**.

2. Go to the **Peripherals** tab. Select the LCD direct drive resource, and set the parameters as shown in **Figure 1**:

   **Figure 1. Device Configurator - LCD direct drive peripheral parameters**

   ![](images/segmentlcd_device_configurator.png)

3. Launch the SegLCD Configurator. Select 4 COM, 8 SEG, and 4 digits. Map all the commons and segments lines.
